# MAIN-VC

## Demo Page
The demo page for MAIN-VC can be found [üëâüèªhere](https://pecholal.github.io/MAIN-VC-demo/)

## Preproces
Directory ```data``` is for data preprocess, including getting mel-spectrograms and making dataset/data loader. After ensuring the dataset location and correctly setting the paths, process the data with
```
./preprocess.sh
```

## Train Model
After configuring the save path, log path, number of iterations, and other settings in train.sh, proceed with the training process.
```
./train.sh
```

## Inference
Once the pretrained vocoder is placed in the specified location, set the source speech, target speech, and output path for the results in ```VCinference.sh```. Then perform inference.
```
./VCinference.sh
```
